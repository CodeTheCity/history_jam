# history_jam

On 19-20 March 2016, Code The City held [History Jam](http://codethecity.org/2016/03/so-how-did-ctc6-the-history-jam-go/) the purpse of which was to create new historical open data and use that in innovative ways. 

This repo contains much of the output of that weekend. 

In the main that was the transcription of 1937 Post Office Business Directories for Central Aberdeen. These are the files titled "1937_ etc"

There is a [transcription checklist](1937_Transcription_progress.csv) which shows what was done, cross-referenced - and what had yet to be done.

Additionally there are some odds and ends such as 
* a partial hunting down of [historically significant gigs in city venues](Historic_Aberdeen_gig_list_tsv.txt) and 
* some attempts to work with OSM IDs, buiding heights and other sources. See [this file](Union_st_OSM_IDS_height_names.TSV.txt). 

Steve Milne wrote about the challenges of the latter [here](https://stevenmilne.com/2016/map-data-glue/) 

Finally, some of this relates to this [other repo](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/histerical) - see if you can work it out!
